The refactor code is good enough. Well structured and well indented. There are somethings to notice :

BookingReposiotry.php

1) Validation is totally missing. I added it.
2) Try catch blocks are missing. I added in some on the functions in BookingReposiotry.php
3) The functions are returning data on conditions but when the conditions are not met there is no return statement.
4) I would use Switch Case statements instead of If/else.

BookingController.php
1) Validation is totally missing.
2) Try catch blocks are totally missing.
